# Quiz-app

This is our Quiz App. It is a trivia challenge about NBC's TV show The Office. In this app, we utilized jQuery to traverse and manipulate the DOM. The index.html file is the bare-bones. Used template generation functions within the Javascript files. Event handlers were used to determine how a user progresses through the quiz as it listens for clicks/tabs and form submissions.
